Here's a complete guide for the custom barrel textures. How it work is by renaming 
a barrel inside an anvil with the proper name. It support multiple layer and it 
is possible to stack multiple different texture over each other. Everything is case
insensitive so you don't have to worry about stuff like "Barre0l" or even "bARreL"
if it is you thing.
